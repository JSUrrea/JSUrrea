<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sebastian Urrea</h1>

---

During my studies, I worked in several fields such as Computer Vision, Data Analytics and Software Development. I did some cool stuff with schedule planning and linear optimization techniques for students at my uni. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at Caseware, with technologies such as Angular, Spring, NestJS, GraphQL and others!

I love learning! I'm currently interested in improving my skills in Flutter and Rust through my personal projects.

I'm from Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ but I consider myself a citizen of the world ðŸŒŽ

Probably, the easiest way to contact me is by email. You can find me at: `js.urrea [at] uniandes.edu.co`
